<p style="font-size:24px">Sustainable living involves adopting eco-friendly practices like using energy-efficient appliances, reducing waste,
 conserving water, and opting for sustainable transportation. It's about making choices that protect our planet for future generations while enjoying
 a healthier, more conscious lifestyle.</P>
<p2 style="font-size:30px">1. Fixing One of Our Biggest Blunders: Sustainable Plastic</p>
<p3 style="font-size:24px">Plastic is everywhere: around our food, deep in the ocean, and inside our bodies. Finding a way to replace plastic is a
 must. Fortunately, entrepreneurs and companies are working to make that happen and have already created smart, sustainable innovations.</p>
<p4 style="font-size:24px">For example, AirCarbon has won several awards because of what it offers: a carbon-negative way of making plastic. It’s
 FDA-approved for food contact – and it’s also food for microorganisms! Since AirCarbon isn’t synthetic plastic, living things can break it down for
 nutrients and make it disappear.</p>
<p5 style="font-size:30px">2. Being Better When Wrapping Your Food: Biodegradable Packaging</p>
<p6 style="font-size:24px">If sustainable plastic is not possible, what about an edible alternative? That’s right: the minds at Mori have created a
 plastic-like food wrap made from natural sources. You can use it to wrap your food and eat it as dessert because they make it from edible silk
 proteins.</p>
<p7 style="font-size:24px">Why do we need biodegradable packaging? We already know the problems plastic causes – but do you fathom the magnitude of those issues? 50% of all plastic is used once and then thrown away. Close to 80% of all plastic is used as food packaging. As you can see, sustainable innovation is much needed in that area, and edible plastic can also help combat food waste as a nice side effect.</p>
<p8 style="font-size:30px">3. Choosing Green to Save Blue: Garbage Bins for the Ocean</p>
<p9 style="font-size:24px">The third item on our list is about plastic too. This time, we bring no alternatives for the future – but a way to fix the many issues of the past.</p>
<p10 style="font-size:24px">Can you name anyone who spends more time on the water than surfers? People in the Navy, maybe. Nevertheless, marines have to go on the water because of their obligations. Surfers do it out of love.</p>
<p11 style="font-size:24px">That love for the waves helped Ceglinski and Turton create the Seabin, a garbage bin for the sea.</p>
<p12 style="font-size:24px">This incredible creation filters detergents, plastics, and oil when you use it: it catches nasty things and releases clean water. What’s the best part? You don’t have to do that much other than buy it and clean it once a month. That’s right: the Seabin does most of the work, so you can relax and know you’re doing your part.</p>

<p13 style="font-size:30px">4.Using the Sunny Side of the Universe: Solar Generators</p>
<p14 style="font-size:24px">Energy consumption is a big issue. There are many harmful ways of generating energy, like burning coal. Unfortunately, only a few are available for those that want to go green</p>
<p15 style="font-size:24px">There’s no need to feel down because of that, especially when you can look up and see one of the biggest sustainable energy sources, the sun.</p>
<p16 style="font-size:24px">Solar generators harness the power of the sun. In doing so, they become an amazing alternative to traditional ways of generating energy. At the same time, solar energy is an affordable option long-term.</p>
<p17  style="font-size:30px">5. Tap Into a Good Thing: Renewable Energy Storage</p>
<p18 style="font-size:24px">Going green takes more than choosing biodegradable food packaging. You have to turn your house into an eco-friendly temple. Winter is right around the corner, so choosing an eco-friendly type of insulation is a must.</p>
<p19 style="font-size:24px">That’s not all! You have to combine your solar generators with an ecological way of storing that energy. That may be hard to do if your entire house is solar-powered and you have an electric car to drive.</p>
<p20 style="font-size:24px">Worry not! Help is on the way: the Asia Pacific is creating a way to increase energy output and decrease greenhouse gases. Their new energy storage system will guarantee an abundance of emission-free energy in the future.</p>
<p21 style="font-size:24px">Why is sustainable energy storage necessary? Because it reduces the emissions, a city generates. When you can store energy for future use, you don’t have to generate it all the time. Since we’re switching to electric cars, it’s something to consider.</p>
