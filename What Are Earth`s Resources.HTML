<p style="font-size:24px">Earthâ€™s natural resources include air, water, soil, minerals, fuels, plants, and animals. Conservation is
 the practice of caring for these resources so all living things can benefit from them now and in the future..<p>
<H2 Style="font-size:35px ">Type Of Resources<H2>
<p>There are two type of resources</p>                                                                                                   
<p2>1.All the things we need to survive, such as food, water, air, and shelter, come from natural resources. Some of these resources, like
 small plants, can be replaced quickly after they are used. Others, like large trees, take a long time to replace. These are renewable
 resources.</p>
<p3>2.Other resources, such as fossil fuels, cannot be replaced at all. Once they are used up, they are gone forever. These are 
nonrenewable resources.</p3>
<H3 Style="font-size:35px">Pollution</H3>
<p4>People often waste natural resources. Animals are overhunted. Forests are cleared, exposing land to wind and water damage.Fertile 
soil is exhausted and lost to erosion because of poor farming practices. Fuel supplies are depleted. Water and air are polluted.</p4>
