<p style="font-size:30px">Need for conservation of Natural Resources:</P>
<p2 style="font-size:24px">We recognise that nature provides for all of our basic requirements, but we have a tendency to excessively abuse it. If we
 continue to exploit nature, there will be no available resources in the future. Thus, conservation of nature is critical for the reasons listed:</P>
<p3 style="font-size:24px">1.To maintain ecological equilibrium necessary for life to exist.</P>
<p4 style="font-size:24px">2.To protect biodiversity</P>
<p5 style="font-size:24px">3.To preserve resources for current and future generations.</P>
<p6 style="font-size:24px">4.To assure the human raceâ€™s survival.</P>
<H2 style="font-size:30px">How We Can Conservation Earth Resources</H2>
<P7 style="font-size:24px">Turning off lights, repairing leaky faucets, and recycling paper, aluminum cans, glass, and plastic are just a few
 examples. Riding bikes, walking, carpooling, and using public transportation all help conserve fuel and reduce the amount of pollutants released
 into the environment.</P>
<p8 style="font-size:24px">Some of the examples of renewable natural resources are sunlight, water, wind, wood and soil. While few of these natural 
resources are available in abundance in nature and can be replenished fast others take time to renew.</p>
<p9 style="font-size:24px">Coal, oil and natural gases are some of the examples of non-renewable natural resources. Though available naturally in the
 environment, these natural resources cannot be replenished or take hundreds of years to recycle.</p>
<p10 style="font-size:24px"> reducing, reusing and recycling of non-renewable resources. Non-human species must be disturbed only to meet the basic 
needs. Planting of more and more trees to save our forest resources. Seeking alternatives to non-renewable resources.</p>
